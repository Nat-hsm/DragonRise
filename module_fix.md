# Module Import Error Fixed

I've fixed the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils.security_enhancements'` error by creating the missing module file.

## What Was Missing

The error occurred because your application was trying to import from a module that didn't exist yet. The import statement in your `app.py` file was:

```python
from utils.security_enhancements import sanitize_input, is_safe_url, verify_user_access, user_access_required
```

But the file `utils/security_enhancements.py` didn't exist in your project.

## What I Did to Fix It

1. Created the missing module file:
   ```
   utils/security_enhancements.py
   ```

2. Implemented all the required functions in this file:
   - `sanitize_input()`: Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks
   - `is_safe_url()`: Checks if a URL is safe to redirect to
   - `verify_user_access()`: Verifies if a user has access to specific data
   - `user_access_required()`: Decorator to ensure users can only access their own data
   - Additional utility functions for validation and security

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Run your application:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

2. The application should start without the module import error.

## Additional Notes

- The security enhancements module is now properly installed and ready to use
- All the security features we discussed earlier are now fully implemented
- The module includes comprehensive input validation and sanitization functions
- Make sure to keep this file in your project as it's now an integral part of your application's security system
