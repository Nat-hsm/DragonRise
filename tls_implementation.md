# TLS 1.2+ Implementation for DragonRise

I've implemented TLS 1.2 (or higher) for your DragonRise application with modern security settings. Here's what was done:

## 1. Enhanced SSL/TLS Configuration

Updated `run.py` to:

- Enforce a minimum TLS version of 1.2
- Use only modern, secure cipher suites
- Disable compression to mitigate CRIME attacks
- Create a proper SSL context with secure defaults

```python
# Create SSL context with modern security settings
ssl_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)

# Set minimum TLS version to 1.2
ssl_context.minimum_version = ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1_2

# Set preferred ciphers (modern, secure ciphers)
ssl_context.set_ciphers('ECDHE+AESGCM:ECDHE+CHACHA20:DHE+AESGCM:DHE+CHACHA20')

# Disable compression (CRIME attack mitigation)
ssl_context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_COMPRESSION
```

## 2. Improved Certificate Generation

Updated `generate_cert.py` to:

- Use SHA-256 for certificate signatures
- Generate 2048-bit RSA keys
- Create certificates valid for one year

## 3. Security Benefits

This implementation provides:

- **Strong Encryption**: Only modern cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy
- **Protocol Security**: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are disabled due to known vulnerabilities
- **Attack Mitigation**: Protection against BEAST, CRIME, and other TLS attacks
- **Future Compatibility**: Works with modern browsers that require TLS 1.2+

## How to Use

1. **Generate SSL certificates** (if you haven't already):
   ```
   python generate_cert.py
   ```

2. **Run your application**:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

3. **Access your application** securely:
   ```
   https://localhost:5000
   ```

## Browser Compatibility

This configuration is compatible with:

- Chrome 30+ (released 2013)
- Firefox 27+ (released 2014)
- Safari 7+ (released 2013)
- Edge (all versions)
- Internet Explorer 11+ with Windows 7+

## Production Recommendations

For production environments:

1. **Use a trusted certificate** from a Certificate Authority
2. **Enable HSTS** (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
3. **Configure OCSP stapling** for improved performance
4. **Set up automatic certificate renewal**

The current implementation provides strong security for development and testing. For production deployment, consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache with professionally managed certificates.
